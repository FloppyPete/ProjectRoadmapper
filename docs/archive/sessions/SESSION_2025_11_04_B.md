# Session 2025-11-04-B: Phase 1 Kickoff - CLI Foundation

**Date:** November 4, 2025  
**Phase:** Phase 1 (Core Documentation & CLI Foundation)  
**Focus:** Begin Phase 1 implementation - Project identity, documentation refactoring, and CLI tool foundation

---

## 📊 Project Context (Brief Roadmap Synopsis)

**From PROJECT_ROADMAP.md:**

**Current Phase:**
- 🔵 Phase 1: Core Documentation & CLI Foundation (In Progress)
- Priority: ⭐⭐⭐ HIGH
- Estimated: 2-3 weeks
- Goal: Build Python CLI tool, refactor documentation, establish project identity

**Recent Completions:**
- ✅ Phase 0 Complete - All foundation goals achieved
- ✅ GitHub repository live and synced
- ✅ 42+ actionable items captured in roadmap

**System Status:**
- ✅ Git repository initialized and synced
- ✅ All foundation files in place
- ✅ Ready to begin Phase 1 development

---

## 🎯 Session Goals

**Primary objectives:**
1. Finalize project identity and branding decisions
2. Plan Python CLI package structure
3. Set up Python project infrastructure (setup.py/pyproject.toml, requirements.txt)
4. Begin CLI tool implementation (`roadmapper init` command)
5. Refactor documentation structure

**Success criteria:**
- [x] Project name finalized (or confirmed as ProjectRoadmapper) ✅
- [x] Python package structure created ✅
- [x] Basic CLI entry point working ✅
- [x] `roadmapper init` command implemented ✅
- [x] `roadmapper session` command implemented ✅
- [x] `roadmapper status` command implemented ✅
- [x] Project structure documented ✅

## 🔧 Work Log

### Phase 1 Planning

**Phase 1 Breakdown (from PROJECT_ROADMAP.md):**

**1.1 Project Identity & Branding**
- Finalize project name
- Create clear value proposition
- Design for discoverability
- Comprehensive README.md (already done, may need updates)
- Set up issues, labels, milestones

**1.2 Documentation Evolution**
- Refactor ROADMAP_CREATOR.md
- Create examples/ directory
- Document dogfooding story

**1.3 CLI Tool Foundation (Python)**
- Create `roadmapper/` package structure
- Implement `roadmapper init` command
- Implement `roadmapper session` command
- Implement `roadmapper status` command
- Package for pip installation

**Approach:**
1. Start with CLI tool foundation (most value)
2. Then refine documentation
3. Finally polish branding

## ✅ Session Accomplishments

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created Python package structure (`roadmapper/` directory)
- ✅ Set up `pyproject.toml` for modern Python packaging
- ✅ Implemented `roadmapper init` command
- ✅ Implemented `roadmapper session` command with auto-incrementing
- ✅ Implemented `roadmapper status` command
- ✅ Created CLI entry point with Click
- ✅ Fixed Windows console encoding issues
- ✅ Installed package in editable mode (`pip install -e .`)
- ✅ All three core CLI commands working

**In Progress:**
- Documentation refinement
- Template improvements

**Deferred:**
- Examples directory (Phase 1.2)
- Full documentation refactoring (can be done incrementally)

**Discoveries:**
- Windows console encoding requires explicit UTF-8 handling
- Click works well for CLI interface
- pyproject.toml is the modern standard for Python packaging
- All three core commands (`init`, `session`, `status`) are functional

### Errors Encountered & Fixed

**1. Windows Console Encoding Error**
- **Error:** `'charmap' codec can't encode character '\U0001f4ca'`
- **Cause:** Windows PowerShell defaults to code page that doesn't support Unicode emojis
- **Fix:** Added `ensure_utf8_console()` utility function that reconfigures stdout/stderr to UTF-8
- **Prevention:** Created `roadmapper/utils.py` with UTF-8 handling utilities

**2. pyproject.toml Validation Error**
- **Error:** `project.authors[0].email` must be idn-email, given value: ""
- **Cause:** Empty email field not allowed in pyproject.toml spec
- **Fix:** Removed email field from authors (only name required)
- **Prevention:** Documented in TROUBLESHOOTING.md

**3. File Encoding Errors**
- **Error:** `'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x9d` when reading template files
- **Cause:** File reads defaulting to system code page instead of UTF-8
- **Fix:** Created `read_text_file()` and `write_text_file()` utilities that always use UTF-8
- **Prevention:** All file operations now use utility functions consistently

**All errors fixed and prevention measures implemented:**
- ✅ Created `roadmapper/utils.py` with UTF-8 handling utilities
- ✅ Updated all file operations to use utility functions
- ✅ Updated all console output to use `ensure_utf8_console()`
- ✅ Created `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` documenting issues and solutions
- ✅ Code now handles Windows encoding issues automatically
