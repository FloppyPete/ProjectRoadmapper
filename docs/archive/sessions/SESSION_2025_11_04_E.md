# Session 2025-11-04-E: Phase 3 Kickoff - Cross-Project Intelligence

**Date:** November 4, 2025  
**Phase:** Phase 3: Cross-Project Intelligence  
**Focus:** Implement cross-project query system and project registry

---

## 📊 Project Context (Brief Roadmap Synopsis)

**From PROJECT_ROADMAP.md:**

**Current Phase:**
- ✅ Phase 2 Complete - Persistence & User Preferences
- 🔵 Phase 3: Cross-Project Intelligence (Starting Now)
- Project has solid CLI foundation, config system, and history tracking

**Recent Completions:**
- ✅ Phase 2 Complete - Config, history, and analytics fully implemented
- ✅ All core CLI commands working (`init`, `session`, `status`, `config`, `history`)
- ✅ Comprehensive configuration system with global/project support
- ✅ Documentation improvements (migration guide, CLI explanation)

**System Status:**
- ✅ CLI tool fully functional and tested
- ✅ Package installable via `pip install -e .`
- ✅ All code working and committed
- 🔧 Ready to start Phase 3 implementation

---

## 🎯 Session Goals

**Primary objectives:**
1. Create project registry system (database/index of all tracked projects)
2. Implement `roadmapper projects` command (list, show status, health)
3. Implement `roadmapper search` command (search across projects)
4. Design and implement project discovery mechanism

**Success criteria:**
- [ ] Projects registry created and persisted
- [ ] `roadmapper projects` command implemented and working
- [ ] `roadmapper search` command implemented and working
- [ ] Can discover and track multiple projects
- [ ] Cross-project queries return useful results

## 🔧 Work Log

### Phase 3.1: Cross-Project Query System

**Plan:**
1. Create `roadmapper/projects.py` module for project registry
2. Store project registry in `~/.roadmapper/projects.json` (or similar)
3. Auto-discover projects when `roadmapper` commands run
4. Implement `roadmapper projects` command group
5. Implement `roadmapper search` command

**Design Decisions:**
- Use JSON for project registry (simple, human-readable)
- Registry stores: project path, name, last session date, health status
- Auto-discovery: scan common project locations or allow manual registration
- Search: search across session files, roadmaps, and history

---

## ✅ Session Accomplishments

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created `roadmapper/projects.py` - Project registry system with JSON storage
- ✅ Implemented project discovery mechanism (scans common project locations)
- ✅ Implemented `roadmapper projects` command group:
  - `list` - List all registered projects with health status
  - `register` - Manually register a project
  - `unregister` - Remove project from registry
  - `discover` - Auto-discover and register projects
- ✅ Project health assessment (healthy/inactive/stale/unknown)
- ✅ Last session tracking across projects
- ✅ Created `roadmapper/search.py` - Cross-project search functionality
- ✅ Implemented `roadmapper search` command:
  - Search across all registered projects
  - Support for session files, roadmaps, and history
  - Filter by file type (`--type`)
  - Filter by specific projects (`--project`)
  - Case-sensitive option (`--case-sensitive`)
  - Configurable max results (`--max-results`)

**Deferred:**
- Phase 3.2 (Cross-Project Dashboard) - Future work
- Phase 3.3 (Knowledge Base) - Future work

**Discoveries:**
- Search functionality is fast and effective for finding solutions across projects
- Health status assessment helps identify stale projects
- Project registry makes cross-project operations seamless
