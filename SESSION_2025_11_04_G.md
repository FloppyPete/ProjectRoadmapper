# Session 2025-11-04-G: Phase 3.3 - Knowledge Base

**Date:** November 4, 2025  
**Phase:** Phase 3.3: Knowledge Base  
**Focus:** Extract and query lessons learned across projects

---

## 📊 Project Context (Brief Roadmap Synopsis)

**From PROJECT_ROADMAP.md:**

**Current Phase:**
- ✅ Phase 3.2 Complete - Cross-Project Dashboard
- 🔵 Phase 3.3: Knowledge Base (Starting Now)
- Project has registry, search, and dashboard working

**Recent Completions:**
- ✅ Phase 3.2 Complete - Web dashboard with metrics and patterns
- ✅ `roadmapper dashboard` command with Flask server
- ✅ Cross-project metrics and health indicators
- ✅ Pattern detection (stale projects, no sessions)

**System Status:**
- ✅ CLI tool fully functional
- ✅ All Phase 3.1-3.2 features working
- 🔧 Ready to implement knowledge base

---

## 🎯 Session Goals

**Primary objectives:**
1. Create knowledge extraction system from session files
2. Extract lessons learned, discoveries, and accomplishments
3. Build searchable knowledge base
4. Implement `roadmapper knowledge` command for queries
5. Connect related discoveries across projects

**Success criteria:**
- [ ] Can extract key information from session files
- [ ] Knowledge stored in searchable format
- [ ] `roadmapper knowledge` command working
- [ ] Can answer "What did I learn about X?"
- [ ] Related discoveries linked across projects

## 🔧 Work Log

### Phase 3.3: Knowledge Base

**Design Decisions:**
- Extract from "Discoveries" and "Session Accomplishments" sections
- Store knowledge in JSON format (~/.roadmapper/knowledge.json)
- Use existing search infrastructure for queries
- Tag knowledge with topics/categories
- Link to source projects and sessions

**Plan:**
1. Create `roadmapper/knowledge.py` module
2. Extract knowledge from session files
3. Store knowledge entries with metadata
4. Implement knowledge query/search
5. Add `roadmapper knowledge` command group

---

## ✅ Session Accomplishments

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created `roadmapper/knowledge.py` - Knowledge extraction and query system
- ✅ Implemented knowledge extraction from session files:
  - Extracts from "Discoveries" section
  - Extracts from "Session Accomplishments" -> "Completed"
  - Extracts insights from "Work Log" section
- ✅ Knowledge stored in JSON format (~/.roadmapper/knowledge.json)
- ✅ Implemented `roadmapper knowledge` command group:
  - `index` - Extract knowledge from all projects
  - `search` - Search knowledge base with filters
  - `learn` - Answer "What did I learn about X?"
  - `stats` - Show knowledge base statistics
- ✅ Cross-project knowledge linking (find related discoveries)
- ✅ Knowledge entries tagged with type (discovery/accomplishment/insight)

**Deferred:**
- Advanced NLP for better topic extraction
- Knowledge graph visualization
- Auto-indexing on session creation
- Export knowledge to various formats

**Discoveries:**
- Regex-based extraction works well for structured session files
- Knowledge base provides valuable "institutional memory"
- Cross-project linking helps find related solutions
- Simple keyword matching is effective for basic queries
