## 🎯 Session Goals

**Primary objectives:**
1. Finalize project identity and branding decisions
2. Plan Python CLI package structure
3. Set up Python project infrastructure (setup.py/pyproject.toml, requirements.txt)
4. Begin CLI tool implementation (`roadmapper init` command)
5. Refactor documentation structure

**Success criteria:**
- [ ] Project name finalized (or confirmed as ProjectRoadmapper)
- [ ] Python package structure created
- [ ] Basic CLI entry point working
- [ ] `roadmapper init` command implemented (or started)
- [ ] Project structure documented

## 🔧 Work Log

### Phase 1 Planning

**Phase 1 Breakdown (from PROJECT_ROADMAP.md):**

**1.1 Project Identity & Branding**
- Finalize project name
- Create clear value proposition
- Design for discoverability
- Comprehensive README.md (already done, may need updates)
- Set up issues, labels, milestones

**1.2 Documentation Evolution**
- Refactor ROADMAP_CREATOR.md
- Create examples/ directory
- Document dogfooding story

**1.3 CLI Tool Foundation (Python)**
- Create `roadmapper/` package structure
- Implement `roadmapper init` command
- Implement `roadmapper session` command
- Implement `roadmapper status` command
- Package for pip installation

**Approach:**
1. Start with CLI tool foundation (most value)
2. Then refine documentation
3. Finally polish branding

## ✅ Session Accomplishments

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created Python package structure (`roadmapper/` directory)
- ✅ Set up `pyproject.toml` for modern Python packaging
- ✅ Implemented `roadmapper init` command
- ✅ Implemented `roadmapper session` command with auto-incrementing
- ✅ Implemented `roadmapper status` command
- ✅ Created CLI entry point with Click
- ✅ Fixed Windows console encoding issues
- ✅ Installed package in editable mode (`pip install -e .`)
- ✅ All three core CLI commands working

**In Progress:**
- Documentation refinement
- Template improvements

**Deferred:**
- Examples directory (Phase 1.2)
- Full documentation refactoring (can be done incrementally)

**Discoveries:**
- Windows console encoding requires explicit UTF-8 handling
- Click works well for CLI interface
- pyproject.toml is the modern standard for Python packaging
- All three core commands (`init`, `session`, `status`) are functional

## 📝 Before Archiving This Session

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Update PROJECT_ROADMAP.md with session summary
- [ ] All git commits made (git status clean)
- [ ] Valuable insights added to roadmap if applicable
- [ ] Archive this file to docs/archive/sessions/
- [ ] Create new SESSION_YYYY_MM_DD_X.md for next session (if continuing)

**Remember:** This is Phase 1 - building the CLI tool that automates what we've been doing manually. Meta level still maximum! 🚀
