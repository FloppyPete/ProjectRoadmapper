## 🔧 Work Log

### Phase 2 Planning

**Phase 2 Breakdown (from PROJECT_ROADMAP.md):**

**2.1 Persistent User Storage**
- Create `~/.roadmapper/` directory for global config
- Implement user preferences storage:
  - Default session template customizations
  - Preferred editor
  - Git commit message templates
  - AI assistant preferences (Cursor, Copilot, etc.)
- Create `roadmapper config` command
  - `roadmapper config set <key> <value>`
  - `roadmapper config get <key>`
  - `roadmapper config list`

**2.2 Project-Level Configuration**
- `.roadmapper.toml` or `.roadmapper.json` in project root
- Store project-specific settings:
  - Custom templates
  - Phase definitions
  - Metrics to track
  - Integration settings

**2.3 Session History & Analytics**
- Track session metadata (duration, files changed, commits)
- Implement `roadmapper history` command
- Basic analytics: sessions per week, average duration, productivity trends

**Approach:**
1. Start with global config (`~/.roadmapper/`)
2. Implement `roadmapper config` command
3. Add project-level configuration
4. Build session history tracking
5. Add analytics
