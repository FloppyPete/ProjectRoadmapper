## 🎯 Session Goals

**Primary objectives:**
1. Plan Phase 2 implementation approach
2. Design user preferences storage structure
3. Begin implementing `~/.roadmapper/` global config
4. Start work on `roadmapper config` command
5. Set up project-level configuration (`.roadmapper.toml`)

**Success criteria:**
- [x] Phase 2 plan documented ✅
- [x] Global config directory structure designed ✅
- [x] `roadmapper config` command implemented ✅

## 🔧 Work Log

### Phase 2 Planning

**Phase 2 Breakdown (from PROJECT_ROADMAP.md):**

**2.1 Persistent User Storage**
- Create `~/.roadmapper/` directory for global config
- Implement user preferences storage:
  - Default session template customizations
  - Preferred editor
  - Git commit message templates
  - AI assistant preferences (Cursor, Copilot, etc.)
- Create `roadmapper config` command
  - `roadmapper config set <key> <value>`
  - `roadmapper config get <key>`
  - `roadmapper config list`

**2.2 Project-Level Configuration**
- `.roadmapper.toml` or `.roadmapper.json` in project root
- Store project-specific settings:
  - Custom templates
  - Phase definitions
  - Metrics to track
  - Integration settings

**2.3 Session History & Analytics**
- Track session metadata (duration, files changed, commits)
- Implement `roadmapper history` command
- Basic analytics: sessions per week, average duration, productivity trends

**Approach:**
1. Start with global config (`~/.roadmapper/`)
2. Implement `roadmapper config` command
3. Add project-level configuration
4. Build session history tracking
5. Add analytics

## ✅ Session Accomplishments

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created `roadmapper/paths.py` - Platform-aware path utilities
- ✅ Created `roadmapper/config.py` - TOML configuration management with merge logic
- ✅ Created `roadmapper/history.py` - Session history tracking (JSONL format)
- ✅ Implemented `roadmapper config` commands: set, get, list, reset
- ✅ Implemented `roadmapper history` commands: list, stats
- ✅ Enhanced `roadmapper status` to show session activity stats
- ✅ Updated `roadmapper/session.py` to log sessions to history
- ✅ Updated dependencies: Added tomli and tomli-w to requirements.txt and pyproject.toml
- ✅ Created `docs/reference/config.md` - Comprehensive configuration guide
- ✅ Updated README.md with Phase 2 features
- ✅ Updated TROUBLESHOOTING.md with config issues

**Phase 2 Complete:**
- ✅ Global config (`~/.roadmapper/config.toml`)
- ✅ Project config (`.roadmapper.toml`)
- ✅ Config CLI with scope support (global/project)
- ✅ Session history tracking (`.roadmapper/history.jsonl`)
- ✅ History analytics (sessions per week, recent activity)
- ✅ Enhanced status display with activity metrics

**Discoveries:**
- TOML libraries (tomli/tomli-w) work well for config management
- JSONL format ideal for append-only history logs
- Config merge logic (project > global > defaults) works smoothly
- History tracking seamlessly integrates with session creation

## 📝 Before Archiving This Session

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Update PROJECT_ROADMAP.md with session summary
- [ ] All git commits made (git status clean)
- [ ] Valuable insights added to roadmap if applicable
- [ ] Archive this file to docs/archive/sessions/
- [ ] Create new SESSION_YYYY_MM_DD_X.md for next session (if continuing)
