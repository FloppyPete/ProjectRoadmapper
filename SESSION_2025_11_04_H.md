### Implemented Automated LLM Review Structure

**Created review infrastructure:**
- `docs/guidance/` folder structure for all reviews
- `docs/guidance/workflow_review/` - First review (moved from docs/)
- `docs/reference/REVIEW_RESPONSE_TEMPLATE.md` - Template for responses
- `docs/reference/REVIEW_TEMPLATE.md` - Guide for creating reviews
- `docs/guidance/README.md` - Index of all reviews

**Automation added:**
- Updated all workflow templates (BOOTSTRAP.md, UPDATE.md, ROADMAP_CREATOR.md, templates.py)
- Added instructions: When user asks for LLM review, automatically:
  - Create `docs/guidance/[review_name]/` folder
  - Create `[review_name]_request.md` with review questions
  - Create `[review_name]_response.md` from template
  - Update `docs/guidance/README.md` with new entry
- User should NEVER manually create review structure - AI handles it automatically

**Structure:**
```
docs/guidance/
├── README.md (index of all reviews)
├── workflow_review/
│   ├── workflow_review_request.md
│   └── workflow_review_response.md (blank template)
└── [future_reviews]/
```

**Usage:**
- User: "Create an LLM review for [topic]"
- AI: Automatically creates folder structure and both files
- User: Share request with larger LLM
- LLM: Fills in response template
- Result: Structured review ready for integration
