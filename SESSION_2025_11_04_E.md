## 🎯 Session Goals

**Primary objectives:**
1. Create project registry system (database/index of all tracked projects)
2. Implement `roadmapper projects` command (list, show status, health)
3. Implement `roadmapper search` command (search across projects)
4. Design and implement project discovery mechanism

**Success criteria:**
- [ ] Projects registry created and persisted
- [ ] `roadmapper projects` command implemented and working
- [ ] `roadmapper search` command implemented and working
- [ ] Can discover and track multiple projects
- [ ] Cross-project queries return useful results

## 🔧 Work Log

### Phase 3.1: Cross-Project Query System

**Plan:**
1. Create `roadmapper/projects.py` module for project registry
2. Store project registry in `~/.roadmapper/projects.json` (or similar)
3. Auto-discover projects when `roadmapper` commands run
4. Implement `roadmapper projects` command group
5. Implement `roadmapper search` command

**Design Decisions:**
- Use JSON for project registry (simple, human-readable)
- Registry stores: project path, name, last session date, health status
- Auto-discovery: scan common project locations or allow manual registration
- Search: search across session files, roadmaps, and history
