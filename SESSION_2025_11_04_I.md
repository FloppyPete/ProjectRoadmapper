# Session 2025-11-04-I: Phase 4.1.1 - YAML Metadata Headers

**Date:** November 4, 2025  
**Phase:** Phase 4.1 - Semantic Structure & Context Enhancement  
**Focus:** Implement YAML/JSON metadata headers in session files for faster LLM context ingestion

> ⚠️ **File Length Reminder:** This session file should stay between 150-250 lines. If approaching 250 lines, consider:
> - Extracting detailed action plans to separate files (e.g., `PHASE_X_ACTION_PLAN.md`)
> - Moving long implementation specs to planning documents
> - Archiving completed work to `docs/archive/sessions/`
> - Starting a new session for the next major feature/task
> 
> See `docs/reference/FILE_ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md` for guidelines.

## 🎯 Session Goals

**Primary objectives:**
1. Add YAML frontmatter to session template with required metadata fields
2. Update session creation logic to auto-populate metadata
3. Update AI assistant instructions to use metadata for faster context parsing
4. Test metadata extraction and usage

**Success criteria:**
- [x] Session template includes YAML frontmatter with all required fields ✅
- [x] New sessions auto-populate metadata from project context ✅
- [x] AI assistant instructions updated to read and use metadata ✅
- [ ] Documentation updated with metadata usage examples (in progress)
- [x] All changes committed and tested ✅

## 🔧 Work Log

### Understanding Current Session Template Structure

Let me first examine the current session template and session creation logic.

---

## ✅ Session Accomplishments

**Completed:**
- ✅ Added YAML frontmatter to session template with all required metadata fields
- ✅ Created `_extract_roadmap_metadata()` function to parse PROJECT_ROADMAP.md
- ✅ Updated `create_session()` to auto-populate metadata from roadmap
- ✅ Fixed variable scoping issues in session creation logic
- ✅ Updated AI assistant workflow instructions to use YAML metadata
- ✅ Tested metadata extraction and auto-population (working correctly)

**Deferred:**
- [TBD]

**Discoveries:**
- **YAML frontmatter enables instant context parsing** - AI can read project/phase/goals without parsing entire file
- **Metadata extraction is straightforward** - Regex patterns work well for extracting project name and current phase
- **Auto-population reduces manual work** - Sessions now automatically have correct metadata from roadmap
- **Template placeholders work well** - Simple string replacement handles all metadata fields

## 📝 Before Archiving This Session

**When user wants to start a new session, YOU (the AI assistant) should automatically:**
- Update PROJECT_ROADMAP.md with session summary
- Check that all git commits are made (git status clean)
- Archive this file to docs/archive/sessions/
- Create new SESSION_YYYY_MM_DD_X.md for next session (if continuing)

**User should NEVER manually archive or copy files - you handle this automatically.**

**Remember:** This is YOUR working document. Use it however helps you work best. Document freely, commit frequently, stay grounded in the roadmap.
