# 🚀 ProjectRoadmapper Bootstrap

**One file. Paste this into your project. Tell Cursor: "Read BOOTSTRAP.md and set up the workflow."**

---

## 🤖 Instructions for AI Assistant (Cursor)

**Your job:** Set up the ProjectRoadmapper workflow for this project automatically.

**Steps:**
1. ✅ **Check for ProjectRoadmapper updates** (if this project was cloned from ProjectRoadmapper):
   - Check if `.git` exists and has a remote pointing to ProjectRoadmapper
   - If yes: Run `git pull` to get latest templates and updates
   - If no: This is fine - templates are embedded below
2. ✅ Create directory structure: `docs/reference/` and `docs/archive/sessions/`
3. ✅ Create `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` from template below
4. ✅ Create `docs/reference/SESSION_WORKING_TEMPLATE.md` from template below
5. ✅ Create first session file: `SESSION_YYYY_MM_DD_A.md` (use today's date)
6. ✅ Initialize git if not already initialized
7. ✅ Ask user a few questions to customize PROJECT_ROADMAP.md:
   - What is this project called?
   - What is the main goal?
   - What are 3-5 major phases/milestones?
8. ✅ Fill in PROJECT_ROADMAP.md with their answers
9. ✅ Make initial git commit

**Important:** Handle everything automatically. User should not manually copy or archive files.

## 📝 Template: PROJECT_ROADMAP.md

Create this file in project root:

```markdown
# 📖 Quick Start

**Living Roadmap** for [PROJECT_NAME]

**6-Step Workflow**: Plan → Consult (optional) → Implement → Document → Sanity Check → Repeat

**Philosophy**: *"Automate the predictable; document the decisions."*

---

## 🤖 AI Assistant Workflow

**Every conversation start:**
1. ✅ **Check for ProjectRoadmapper updates** (optional but recommended):
   - If this project was cloned from ProjectRoadmapper repo: Run `git pull` in that repo to get latest templates
   - If BOOTSTRAP.md exists: Check if it's outdated (can compare version or suggest re-copying)
2. ✅ Read this file (PROJECT_ROADMAP.md) - Current Status section
3. ✅ Check for `SESSION_YYYY_MM_DD_X.md` in root
4. ✅ If exists: Read it, continue that session
5. ✅ If not: **Automatically create new session** (increment letter: A→B→C or new date)

**Starting a new session (when user says "new session" or "start new session"):**
- **Automatically archive** any existing `SESSION_*.md` file to `docs/archive/sessions/`
- **Automatically create** new `SESSION_YYYY_MM_DD_X.md` file from template
- **Automatically update** PROJECT_ROADMAP.md with brief summary of archived session
- User should NEVER manually archive or copy templates - you do this automatically

**During session:**
- Use SESSION file as scratchpad freely
- Git commit after each logical unit
- Ask before deleting/major changes
- Update working doc with progress

**Session end (when user says "end session" or "archive session"):**
- Update this roadmap briefly with session summary
- **Automatically archive** SESSION file to docs/archive/sessions/
- **Automatically create** new session file if user wants to continue
- Ensure git clean

**Key principle:** Always in a session. Always grounded in roadmap. Commit frequently. **YOU handle archiving and session creation automatically - never ask the user to do manual file operations.**

**Template:** `docs/reference/SESSION_WORKING_TEMPLATE.md`

## 📝 Before Archiving This Session

**When user wants to start a new session, YOU (the AI assistant) should automatically:**
- Update PROJECT_ROADMAP.md with session summary
- Check that all git commits are made (git status clean)
- Archive this file to docs/archive/sessions/
- Create new SESSION_YYYY_MM_DD_X.md for next session (if continuing)

**User should NEVER manually archive or copy files - you handle this automatically.**

---

**Remember:** This is YOUR working document. Use it however helps you work best. Document freely, commit frequently, stay grounded in the roadmap.
```

---

## ✅ That's It!

**For the user:** Paste this file into your project root, then tell Cursor:
```
Read BOOTSTRAP.md and set up the workflow for this project
```

Cursor will do everything automatically. No CLI needed. No manual copying. Just paste and ask. ✨

---

## 🔄 Keeping Templates Updated

**If you cloned ProjectRoadmapper:** Cursor will automatically check for updates when starting sessions.

**If you just copied BOOTSTRAP.md:** To get latest templates, either:
- Re-copy BOOTSTRAP.md from the latest ProjectRoadmapper repo
- Or tell Cursor: "Check if BOOTSTRAP.md is up to date with ProjectRoadmapper"

This keeps all your projects using the latest workflow improvements!
