## 🔧 Work Log

### Phase 3.2: Cross-Project Dashboard

**Design Decisions:**
- Use Flask for lightweight web server (easy to add as optional dependency)
- Create simple HTML templates (no complex frontend framework)
- Use existing projects registry and search functionality
- Dashboard will be optional (not required for core functionality)
- Start with basic overview, add features incrementally

**Plan:**
1. Add Flask as optional dependency
2. Create `roadmapper/dashboard.py` module
3. Create HTML templates for dashboard
4. Implement routes: overview, project details, metrics
5. Add `roadmapper dashboard` command
6. Add pattern detection logic

## ✅ Session Accomplishments

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created `roadmapper/dashboard.py` - Dashboard data gathering and HTML template
- ✅ Implemented `get_dashboard_data()` - Aggregates cross-project metrics
- ✅ Implemented `detect_patterns()` - Simple pattern detection (stale projects, no sessions)
- ✅ Created HTML dashboard template with modern styling
- ✅ Added `roadmapper dashboard` command to CLI
- ✅ Flask integration with optional dependency (`roadmapper[dashboard]`)
- ✅ Dashboard features:
  - Overview of all registered projects
  - Health indicators (healthy/inactive/stale/unknown)
  - Cross-project metrics (total sessions, recent activity)
  - Pattern detection and warnings
  - Responsive grid layout

**Deferred:**
- Advanced pattern detection (common issues/solutions across projects)
- Real-time updates (currently requires refresh)
- Individual project detail pages
- Export functionality

**Discoveries:**
- Flask is a good choice for lightweight dashboard (optional dependency)
- Template rendering works well with Jinja2
- Pattern detection can be enhanced incrementally
- Dashboard provides useful overview at a glance
